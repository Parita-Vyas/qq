# RAG
RAG, short for **Retrieval-Augmented Generation**, is like a smart librarian paired with a storyteller. Imagine youâ€™re writing a report but donâ€™t remember all the factsâ€”you quickly look things up in a trusted book and then weave it into your writing. Thatâ€™s what RAG does! Instead of making things up entirely on its own, an AI first "retrieves" relevant info from documents (like searching a internal knowledge base) and then "generates" a response using that info in the language you understand. This makes answers more accurate and up-to-date, especially when working with personal or sensitive topics. Itâ€™s like giving the AI a reference sheet to ensure it gives you the best possible answer!
